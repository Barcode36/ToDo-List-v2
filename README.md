# MyToDoList

ToDo list was created as a light-weight tool to help me organize my daily tasks.
For this project I've used RecyclerView, SQLite and MVC pattern. It's not finished yet.

### Features
- Be able to add tasks, use it as a shopping list or whatever use you find interesting.

### Near future updates
- Be able to delete and edit tasks.
- Be able to personalize your app's style.
- Be able to have priorities in your tasks

### Long term project
- First make this app a Notes App and then create a fully-working productivity App using this as a base project.
